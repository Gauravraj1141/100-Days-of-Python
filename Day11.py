# it will execute till condition will be false means if condition will true then it will execute
# so we use here 1 or True means both are true then it will run infinite

# while loop wins because it is some faster than for loop

# hey dowhile loop in python doesn't exist but we can make a do while loop in python let's see how emulate it:
# in dowhile loop condition will true always first time means when we run dowhile loop then the codition will true or not but dowhile's loop content will run and then it checks the conditon
#
# i = 3
# print(i)
# # so content of loop one time will run wheather condition ture or not
# while(i<3):
#     print(i)

# other languages do while loop


# do{
#     # loop body
#     # so this loop body will always run if condition true or not
# }while(condition);

# i =0
# while(i<33):
#     i = int(input("enter a number : "))
#     print("hey this is a number and this line prints one time medtary then print this ")
#     print("hekssdfa")
#     continue
#     print("this line print when condition will true ")
#     break
